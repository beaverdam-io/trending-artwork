homage to Raawii and Vilhelm Lundstrøm.\n\nAs fans of Vilhelm Lundstrøm’s work, we immediately fell in love with the Raawii Strøm Collection by Danish designer Nicholas Wiig Hansen. \n\nThe clean geometric shapes and bright colors inspired us to create a homage where each object of the collection is treated as a character with it’s own characteristics. \n\nThe result is a colorful and surreal
