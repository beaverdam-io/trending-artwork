I carefully structured this course to be of the highest of quality that you’d expect as a full standalone creature texturing module in a university.\n\n*****GUMROAD LINK*****\nhttp://bit.ly/3dc9Jk7​\n          \nWhat is this course?\nThis is a pre-recorded online texturing course, with each step recorded and structured into bite size chapters. Going from preparing a model for texturing - through to exporting final textures out of Mari.\n\nIn the VFX industry it's almost impossible to be given an asset without photo reference to work towards, and this course will focus on creating photo-realistic textures. We won't be creating these textures from our head, we'll be referencing photography though the entire process to give us direction and inspiration. We’ll talk extensively on how to break down this photography and building the textures based on your own observations, to come up with a plan for how we will approach the asset. \n\n\nI just want to say a big thank you to Penggao Yu - he is the talented modeller who sculpted this crocodile.
