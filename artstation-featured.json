The details don’t stop there, though: the film is loaded with in-jokes callbacks to Tyler’s past work, Tony’s heroes and influences, and the current West Virginia indie country music scene.

Designed by Morten \u0026 Jonas 2018\n\nDaybe belongs to a new generation of daybeds designed to balance function and practicality with well-being and style. Although the sofa appears to form a fixed shape, the backrest detaches and slides onto the floor to create a comfortable bed. Unlike conventional sofa beds constructed from coils, springs and levers, Daybe converts into a bed in one smooth motion.\n\nDaybe’s seat and backrest are underpinned by a lightweight metal frame available with or without armrests. The optional armrests are crafted from strips of smooth black metal that extend behind the sofa to form a streamlined backrest.\n\nThe armrests and backrest maximise Daybe’s comfort without affecting the ease with which it transforms into a bed and back again. Available in a variety of fabrics, the sofa provides relaxation during daytime and encourages deep sleep and sweet dreams at night.","publishDate":"Tue, 12 May 2020 14:52:40 -0500"},"author":{"id":"smok123","url":"https://www.behance.net/smok123","username":"Luka Spasojevic","fullName":""},"artworkURL":"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/projects/404/a509ac96993645.Y3JvcCwxOTk5LDE1NjQsMCwzNDY.jpg","platform":"Behance","platformURL":"https://www.behance.net/","date":"Sun, 14 Feb 2021 01:02:13 -0500","adultContent":false,"sharedOn":{"platformName":"","postURL":"","postID":"","postDate":""}},{"project":{"id":"95770615","url":"https://www.behance.net/gallery/95770615/Isolation-Dreams","title":"Isolation-Dreams","description":"Series of personal illustrations created through Q3 2019-Q1 2020","publishDate":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 13:09:15 -0500"},"author":{"id":"vatash","url":"https://www.behance.net/vatash","username":"Prateek Vatash","fullName":""},"artworkURL":"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/projects/404/50134095770615.Y3JvcCwxNDAwLDEwOTUsMCwxMjg.jpg","platform":"Behance","platformURL":"https://www.behance.net/","date":"Sun, 14 Feb 2021 01:01:15 -0500","adultContent":false,"sharedOn":{"platformName":"","postURL":"","postID":"","postDate":""}},{"project":{"id":"95605115","url":"https://www.behance.net/gallery/95605115/3D-Tire-Pilot-Sport-Full-CGI-Shots","title":"3D-Tire-Pilot-Sport-Full-CGI-Shots","description":"Michelin Pilot Sport 3D tire - Fully Modeled - best texture resolution","publishDate":"Sat, 18 Apr 2020 14:41:45 -0500"},"author":{"id":"lukasmirek6eb0","url":"https://www.behance.net/lukasmirek6eb0","username":"Lukas Mirek","fullName":""},"artworkURL":"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/projects/404/effce795605115.Y3JvcCw4MDgsNjMyLDAsMA.jpg","platform":"Behance","platformURL":"https://www.behance.net/","date":"Sun, 14 Feb 2021 01:02:17 -0500","adultContent":false,"sharedOn":{"platformName":"","postURL":"","postID":"","postDate":""}},{"project":{"id":"95428663","url":"https://www.behance.net/gallery/95428663/Ecobee","title":"Ecobee","description":"Created as part of a global rebrand to coincide with the launch of Ecobee’s new SmartHome products – FutureDeluxe have been commissioned to design, direct and craft a series of product films and key visuals to help bring Ecobee to the forefront of SmartHome innovation.","publishDate":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 07:59:46 -0500"},"author":{"id":"pawel-pecherzewski","url":"https://www.behance.net/pawel-pecherzewski","username":"PaweÅ PÄcherzewski","fullName":""},"artworkURL":"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/projects/404/5cfd0c95428663.Y3JvcCw3MTIsNTU3LDMzOCw5MA.png","platform":"Behance","platformURL":"https://www.behance.net/","date":"Sun, 14 Feb 2021 01:02:19 -0500","adultContent":false,"sharedOn":{"platformName":"","postURL":"","postID":"","postDate":""}},{"project":{"id":"94074447","url":"https://www.behance.net/gallery/94074447/Evolution-of-Sleep","title":"Evolution-of-Sleep","description":"The fine folk at Purple approached us with a clear brief; to visualise the feels you feel from their proprietary Purple Grid mattress and pillow tech.
