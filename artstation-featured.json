Block Column  - Substance Source Signature Collection","description":"I had a lot of fun making this substance. My approach was with a sculptural mindset, the idea, to make a column generator that could turn any cylinder into an ornate stone column. Once I had the basic parameters set up to control the shape I was able to have plenty of fun coming up with different profiles and patterns with which to decorate the columns. The various components of the column can be controlled and respond to each other automatically. Scaling one section repositions other elements to keep measurements and counts consistent. If you didn't want to use this substance to create columns the material outputs would also serve well for a trim sheet.\n\nIt is part of my Medieval themed Signature Collection for Substance Source which I had the pleasure of working on with the awesome people of the Substance Source team over at Adobe. I set myself a few goals for the set. The most important of which was thorough customisability of each material, I wanted each substance in the collection to have numerous parameters with variations of the main graph could easily be created to give the user a lot of flexibility to customise each material to the needs of their specific projects.","publishDate":"2021-01-14T10:17:03.297-06:00"},"author":{"id":"218771","url":"http://www.artstation.com/oggyart","username":"oggyart","fullName":"Mark Foreman"},"artworkURL":"https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/covers/images/033/816/061/small_square/mark-foreman-mark-foreman-mark-foreman-substance-source-stone-block-column-thumb.jpg?1610639063","platform":"Artstation","platformURL":"https://www.artstation.com/","date":"","adultContent":false,"sharedOn":"","sharedOnURL":"","sharedOnID":""},{"project":{"id":"9082739","url":"https://www.artstation.com/artwork/g23QdE","title":"-MOTHERHOOD-","description":"-MOTHERHOOD- something's brooding....","publishDate":"2021-01-14T09:26:53.840-06:00"},"author":{"id":"4364","url":"http://www.artstation.com/mutte","username":"mutte","fullName":"Maarten Verhoeven"},"artworkURL":"https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/033/815/450/20210114092559/small_square/maarten-verhoeven-motherhood-master-cc-002-ld-se.jpg?1610637959","platform":"Artstation","platformURL":"https://www.artstation.com/","date":"","adultContent":false,"sharedOn":"","sharedOnURL":"","sharedOnID":""},{"project":{"id":"9083224","url":"https://www.artstation.com/artwork/68XG6W","title":"Skemfar Avenger","description":"For Magic The Gathering, Kaldheim, a viking inspired set.\n\nAD: Cynthia Sheppard\nPrints: https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/vargasni/skemfar-avenger/","publishDate":"2021-01-14T10:06:14.108-06:00"},"author":{"id":"105","url":"http://www.artstation.com/vargasni","username":"vargasni","fullName":"Randy Vargas (vargasni)"},"artworkURL":"https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/covers/images/033/816/842/small_square/randy-vargas-vargasni-randy-vargas-vargasni-art.jpg?1610640370","platform":"Artstation","platformURL":"https://www.artstation.com/","date":"","adultContent":false,"sharedOn":"","sharedOnURL":"","sharedOnID":""},{"project":{"id":"9081800","url":"https://www.artstation.com/artwork/rAd1EL","title":"Technicians on Call","description":"__________\nYou know what to do if you want.\nwww.facebook.com/ismail.inceoglu\nwww.facebook.com/seventeenthart\nwww.instagram.com/seven.teenth\nwww.twitter.com/seven_teenth","publishDate":"2021-01-14T06:48:03.362-06:00"},"author":{"id":"108083","url":"http://www.artstation.com/seventeenth","username":"seventeenth","fullName":"Ismail Inceoglu"},"artworkURL":"https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/033/810/467/20210114064548/small_square/ismail-inceoglu-technicians-on-call.jpg?1610628348","platform":"Artstation","platformURL":"https://www.artstation.com/","date":"","adultContent":false,"sharedOn":"","sharedOnURL":"","sharedOnID":""},{"project":{"id":"9083396","url":"https://www.artstation.com/artwork/L3BGKK","title":"The year of the ox(porcelain）","description":"The year of the ox is coming!!\nThese images are NOT CGI,but made by ZBrush/3d print/artisan's hand plus clay and fire from my hometown JingDeZhen.\nEvery little elf has a porcelain body and a heart:)\nThe red one called“Happy red”，the white one called“Hundredfold crackle”，and the black one called “Galaxy”，hope you like them！","publishDate":"2021-01-14T10:24:31.452-06:00"},"author":{"id":"10330","url":"http://www.artstation.com/zhelong","username":"zhelong","fullName":"Zhelong Xu"},"artworkURL":"https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/033/817/118/20210114102312/small_square/zhelong-xu-810a8212.jpg?1610641392","platform":"Artstation","platformURL":"https://www.artstation.com/","date":"","adultContent":false,"sharedOn":"","sharedOnURL":"","sharedOnID":""},{"project":{"id":"9080493","url":"https://www.artstation.com/artwork/oAleyL","title":"Yeon_Winter girl ver.","description":"My intended concept.
